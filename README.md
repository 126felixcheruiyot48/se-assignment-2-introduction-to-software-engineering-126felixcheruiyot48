Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

A. Agile model - development is carried out in small,iteractive cycles(sprints/iterations) with each iteraction incluiding planning,development,testing and review emphasizing on collaboration with stakeholders and contionous feedback. It is flexible and adaptive to changes even late in the development process.

B. Waterfall model - development follows a linear and sequential approach moving from one place to the naxt.Emphasizes on clear requirements and comprehensive documentation before development begins.Difficult to make changes once project is on the later stages 


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

                      --COMPARISON--
   WATERFALL MODEL uses Linear and sequential that follows a linear path with distinct phases eg requirements, Design, Implementation,Testing,Deployment and maintainance with each phase being completed before the other begins. It emphasizes a structured approach with well-defined phases and extensive documentation.
   AGILE MODEL uses Iteractive and incremential where development is carried out in small iteractive cycles called iterations typically lasting 1-4 weeks involving planning, development, testing and review.It focuses on adaptability and continous improvement allowing for changes throughout development process. 

   WATERFALL MODEL is not flexible with changes being hard to make on later stages of development with each phase depending on the completion of previous phases making it harder to revisit and modify the earlier stages while AGILE MODEL is highly flexible being adaptable to changes even late in development.Iterations allow for contionous feedback and adjustments it is also iterative with frwequent reassessment and reprioritization of tasks based on stakeholder feedback and changing requirements. 

   WATERFALL MODEL has limited customer involement and fixed requirements while AGILE MODEL has contionous customer involvement throughout development process providing continous feedback and validation also requirements evolve based on ongoing customer feedback and changing business need.

   WATERFALL MODEL has comrehensive documentation before development begins with static documents that rarely change throughout project.
   while AGILE MODEL has minimal documentation and dynamic documents that evolve with the project reflecting changes and new insights gained during iterations. 

   WATERFALL MODEL risks are identified and mitigated early in the project during planning phase  while AGILE MODEL continuously identifies risks and assesed and mitigated throughout the development process and frequent testing and feedback loops help identify and address risks early
   in waterfall model their is late testing while in agile model their is continous testing and iterative.

   WATERFALL MODEL has clear milestones and timelines making it easier to predict project duration and cost but not as flexible as AGILE MODEL 
   WATERFALL MODEL has a well defined phase and deliveries provide clear project structure. 

                              --SIMILARITIES--
    1. They are both goal oriented aiming to deliver high quality software that meets customer requirements and business goals. 
    2. They are both structured phases.
    3. They both have documentation.
    4. Testing is an integral part of both models aiming at ensuring the quality and functionality of the software.
    5. Both methodologies use project managenent to plan, execute, monitor and control the development process.
    6. Both models recognise the importance of involving stakeholders.
    7. Effective teamwork and collaboration are crucial for both methodologies.
    8. Quality assurance is emphasised on both models to deliver reliable products
    9. Risk mamnagement is used in both models to anticipate and mitigate potential issues.
    10. Both aim at satifying customers

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

DEFINITION:
 Systematic and disciplined approach to the specifications and management of needs throughout the software development lifecycles encompassing all activities related dicovering,documentation,analyzing and validating requirements for a software system.

PROCESSES: 
1. Discovery - gathering requirements from various stakeholders incluiding customers, users and other relevant parties.Interviews,workshops,surveys and observations are used to elicit requirements
2. Documentation - puting requirements in structured format to ensure clarity and understanding among all stakeholders.
3. Analysis - requirements are analysed to ensure they are complete,consistent,feasible and unambigous.It involves prioritizing requirements and resolving conflicts.
4. Validation - to ensure requirements are accurately captured ie needs and expectations of stakeholders.done through reviews ,walkthroughs, prototyping and simulations.
5. Management - establishing baselines, maintaining traceability and ensuring that requirements align with project goals and constraints.

IMPORTANCE:
1. Understanding stakeholder needs ie allignment with business goals helping prioritize features and functionalities that provide most value to stakeholders. It also helps understand user expectations.
2.  Guiding Development and design  ie forms a  basis for design decisions helping form the architecture , components and interfaces of the sofware system 
3. Managing complexity and scope. scope of project is defined through documentation clarifying what is included and what is excluded from software development effort.
4. Communication and collaboration - forms common language between stakeholders,developers,testers and other project participants teams can also collaborate to come up with projects.
5. Quality assurance through forming a basis for validating and verifying the software system they enable testers to develop test cases that ensure software functions as intended and meets user expectations.
6. Change Management facilitates change control processes allowing stakeholders asses impact of change and makes informed decisions wether to approve or reject them.every implemented feature or functionality can be traced back to its original requirement helping maintain consistency and ensures all specified requirements are addressed.
7. continous improvements by use of iterative development methodologies.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

it is a fundamental principle in software design that promotes flexibility,maintainability,scalability and reusability of software systems
it involves dividing a software system into smaller, independent,manageable modules or components.and each module is responsible for a specific feature of the system and modules are designed to interact with each other through well defined interfaces.

Scalability - alows developers add or modify modules independantly.New features can be implemented by adding new modules or modifying existing ones without affecting entire system.

Maintainability - Modular systems are easier to maintain because changes are localised to specific modules. Developers can update or fix issues within a module without impacting other parts of the system, reducing risk of unintended consiquences

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.


Version control systems (VCS) are tools used to manage changes to source code and other collections of information. They allow multiple developers to collaborate on projects, keep track of changes, and maintain a history of every modification made. VCS are essential in software development for several reasons:

Importance of Version Control Systems
Collaboration:

Facilitates teamwork: Multiple developers can work on different parts of a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently and merge them back into the main project once they are complete.
History Tracking:

Record of changes: Every change is recorded with a timestamp, author information, and a commit message describing the change.
Revert changes: It is possible to roll back to previous versions if new changes introduce bugs or issues.
Backup and Restore:

Data safety: Version control systems act as a backup by storing copies of the project at various stages.
Disaster recovery: In case of data loss or corruption, it is easy to recover previous versions of the project.
Code Integrity:

Code reviews: Changes can be reviewed by team members before they are integrated into the main codebase, improving code quality.
Conflict resolution: Helps in identifying and resolving conflicts that occur when multiple developers modify the same part of the codebase.
Project Management:

Milestones and releases: VCS can manage different versions of the software, marking specific commits as releases or milestones.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Integration with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
